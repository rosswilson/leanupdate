# Lean Update

![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/rosswilson/leanupdate/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)

Sharing regular progress updates across multiple teams can be tricky. Rather than scheduling a weekly video call, what
if each team could submit a few words (asyncronously, when it suits them) and a sharable newsletter is composed automatically?

This is just a hobby side-project, but I hope that Lean Update could be used to share quick updates across teams.
